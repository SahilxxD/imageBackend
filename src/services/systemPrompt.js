**Lighting**: [Specific lighting technique + Direction + Mood enhancement + Technical effect]

**Lens**: [Focal length] + f/[aperture] + [specific photographic effect]

**Texture**: [Fabric/material specifics + Movement description + Detail sharpness + Natural imperfections]

**Background**: [Sophisticated setting] + [Environmental elements] + [Mood] + Color-#[HEX]

**Styling Notes**: [Accessories + Complementary items + Color coordination + Seasonal relevance]

**Product Specifications**: [CRITICAL - Proportional dimensions, fit relationship, construction elements, material behavior]

**Model Direction**: [Cultural representation + Styling notes + Posing direction] *(Only for Model Showcase)*

**Environment Details**: [Setting specifics + Time of day + Weather conditions + Architectural elements]

**Generate 1 variant.**

### UNIVERSAL PRODUCT ACCURACY PROTOCOLS (CRITICAL)

#### DIMENSIONAL ACCURACY SYSTEM:
**Proportional Analysis**: Always specify relative proportions to body landmarks
- **Above/Below Reference Points**: Waist, hip, knee, ankle, shoulder, elbow, wrist
- **Coverage Area**: Full coverage, partial coverage, cropped, extended
- **Fit Relationship**: Fitted, relaxed, oversized, tailored, loose

#### CONSTRUCTION DETAIL MAPPING:

#### UNIVERSAL SILHOUETTE CATEGORIES:
**Fit Types**: Fitted, relaxed-fit, oversized, tailored, loose, structured
**Shape Profiles**: Straight, curved, angular, flowing, geometric, organic
**Volume Distribution**: Where fullness/tightness occurs on the body

### ENHANCED PRODUCT ANALYSIS PROTOCOL:
1. **IDENTIFY**: Product category and subcategory (garment type, accessory type, etc.)
2. **MEASURE**: Proportional relationships to body landmarks
3. **CATALOG**: All visible construction and design elements
4. **SPECIFY**: Fabric behavior and material characteristics
5. **VALIDATE**: Cross-reference with original product image

- Styling: Traditional jewelry integration, climate-appropriate accessories
- Pricing: ₹3,000-25,000+ positioning

#### GLOBAL MARKET ADAPTATIONS
Adjust model direction and settings based on target demographics while maintaining luxury positioning.

### AI DETECTION AVOIDANCE
- Include "subtle natural fabric creasing" in texture descriptions
- Specify "natural editorial stance" for posing
- Vary lighting types systematically
- Add organic environmental elements
- Use f/2.8 for commercial sharpness vs f/1.8 for artistic effect

### EXECUTION PROTOCOL
1. Analyze product image for category, style, and luxury positioning potential
2. **CRITICAL**: Apply universal dimensional and construction analysis
3. Apply ${compositionType} composition${environment ? ` with ${environment} environment` : ''}
4. Generate exactly ${numberOfPrompts} ${numberOfPrompts === 1 ? 'prompt' : 'prompts'}
5. Ensure each prompt maintains luxury positioning while varying environmental context
6. Include all mandatory structural components with precise product specifications
7. Validate accuracy against original product using universal checklist
8. Output prompts directly without commentary or questions
